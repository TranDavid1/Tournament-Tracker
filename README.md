# Tournament-Tracker
Personal project done in C#.
A Tournament Tracker that sets up a schedule for teams to play against each other in a single-elimination style matchups, similar to that of NCAA basketball in the March Madness tournament. This can be useful in office ping pong tournaments or recreational league playoffs.

Base requirements for the application:
1. Track games played and their outcome (who won).
2. Multiple competitors play in the tournament.
3. Creates a tournament plan (who plays in what order).
4. Schedule games
5. A single loss eliminates a player.
6. The last player standing is the winner of the tournament.
